In an attempt to get better at SQL, I'm solving the questions on https://sqlzoo.net/. This repository contains my solutions. Up to date as of 11/1/2020. The solution to the last question on COVID-19 seems correct but is sorted in incorrect output. Note that some of the assessment answers are drafts of answers rather than the answers themselves.
